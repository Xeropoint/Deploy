# Why?
	We want to be able to reliably identify what has been changed, and what needs to be updated.
	By keeping a list of all the files that need to be deployed into a fresh Avorion install, as well as 'merged'
	files such as server/server.lua, we can easily and reliably do this.

# How
	##installation
	Copy over all files from the Avorion folder to a fresh Avorion install's Avorion folder.

	##Updating mods
	###new mods
	* Simply add all new files to the file structure.
	* If files are already present, run a comparison, or find out what needs to happen.
	* Check to see what vanilla files need modified, e.g. /server/server.lua

	##existing Mods
	* Check mod log history/version history for compatibility notes for upgrading
	* copy over new files
	* verify no stale files are present (e.g. did mod remove or rename some of its files?)
	* Verify the registration prodcedure hasnt changed
